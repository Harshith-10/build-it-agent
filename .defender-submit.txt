# Information for Microsoft Defender False Positive Submission

APPLICATION INFORMATION:
========================
Application Name: BuildITAgent
Version: 1.0.1
Developer: Institute of Aeronautical Engineering
Website: https://www.iare.ac.in

FILE INFORMATION:
=================
Filename: build-it-agent.exe
Purpose: Educational Assessment & Code Execution Tool
Target Platform: Windows (x86_64)

DESCRIPTION:
============
BuildIT Agent is a legitimate educational software application designed for secure online 
coding assessments and examinations. The application is used by educational institutions 
to maintain exam integrity while allowing students to write and execute code.

LEGITIMATE FUNCTIONS:
=====================
1. CODE EXECUTION: Safely executes student-submitted code in multiple programming languages
   (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.) within a controlled environment

2. PROCESS MONITORING: Monitors running processes to detect unauthorized applications during
   exams (e.g., IDEs, AI assistants, browsers) to prevent cheating

3. LOCAL WEB SERVER: Runs a localhost-only web server (127.0.0.1:8910) to receive code
   execution requests from the examination platform

4. WINDOW DETECTION: Enumerates visible windows to identify forbidden applications that
   might be used for unauthorized assistance during assessments

WHY IT TRIGGERS DETECTION:
===========================
The application exhibits behaviors similar to malware due to its legitimate monitoring
and execution capabilities:

- Uses Windows API (EnumWindows, GetWindowThreadProcessId) for process detection
- Spawns child processes via tokio::process::Command for code execution
- Monitors system processes using sysinfo crate
- Runs a network service (Axum web framework) on localhost
- Requests elevated privileges for comprehensive process monitoring

However, ALL these functions are necessary for the application's educational purpose
and operate with user consent during proctored examinations.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================
- Programming Language: Rust
- Build Tool: Cargo
- Web Framework: Axum (for local API)
- Process Monitoring: sysinfo crate, Windows API
- Async Runtime: Tokio

SECURITY MEASURES:
==================
- Only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1), never external networks
- No data exfiltration - all code execution is local
- Sandboxed execution with timeouts to prevent malicious code
- Open source - code can be audited
- Embedded version information and application manifest
- Clearly identifies purpose through metadata

FALSE POSITIVE DETAILS:
=======================
Detected as: Trojan:Win32/Sabsik.FL.A!ml
Detection Date: 09-10-2025 10:02
Status: Quarantine failed

This is a FALSE POSITIVE. The application is a legitimate educational tool used by
students during supervised online examinations. It does not contain malicious code,
does not communicate with command & control servers, does not exfiltrate data, and
operates transparently with user knowledge and consent.

VERIFICATION:
=============
The executable contains embedded version information that can be verified:
- Company Name: Institute of Aeronautical Engineering
- Product Name: BuildITAgent
- File Description: Educational code execution and monitoring service
- Comments: Educational code execution and monitoring service for secure online assessments

Please add this executable to the Windows Defender allowlist to prevent disruption
of educational assessments.
