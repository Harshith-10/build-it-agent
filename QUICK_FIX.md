# Windows Defender Quick Fix Guide

## üö® Issue
Windows Defender blocks `build-it-agent.exe` as malware (FALSE POSITIVE)

## ‚úÖ Quick Solutions (Choose One)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ IMMEDIATE FIX: Add Windows Defender Exclusion
**‚ö†Ô∏è Use this to get running quickly, but it's not ideal for distribution**

**Via PowerShell (Run as Administrator):**
```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\full\path\to\build-it-agent.exe"
```

**Via Windows Security GUI:**
1. Open **Windows Security** ‚Üí **Virus & threat protection**
2. Click **Manage settings**
3. Scroll to **Exclusions** ‚Üí Click **Add or remove exclusions**
4. Click **Add an exclusion** ‚Üí Choose **File**
5. Select `build-it-agent.exe`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ REBUILD WITH METADATA (Recommended)
**This adds version info to help Windows Defender recognize it as legitimate**

```bash
# Pull the latest changes (includes build.rs and Windows resources)
git pull

# Rebuild for Windows
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

The new build includes:
- ‚úì Company name and product information
- ‚úì Application description and purpose
- ‚úì Windows manifest with proper permissions
- ‚úì Version information resource

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ SUBMIT FALSE POSITIVE TO MICROSOFT
**Helps everyone who downloads your app**

1. Go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
2. Select **"Submit a file for malware analysis"**
3. Upload: `build-it-agent.exe`
4. Use this description:

```
This is BuildIT Agent, a legitimate educational code execution and 
monitoring tool used for secure online assessments. It monitors processes 
and executes student code during supervised exams. Detection as malware 
is a FALSE POSITIVE.

The application:
- Only runs on localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Does not communicate externally
- Is used with user consent during exams
- Contains embedded version information verifying its purpose
```

5. Microsoft typically responds in 24-48 hours

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ CODE SIGNING (Production/Distribution)
**The ultimate solution - eliminates false positives**

**For Development/Testing (Self-Signed):**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\scripts\sign-executable.ps1 -CreateSelfSigned
```

**For Production (Commercial Certificate - ~$200/year):**
1. Purchase certificate from:
   - [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates)
   - [Sectigo](https://sectigo.com/ssl-certificates-tls/code-signing)
   - [GlobalSign](https://www.globalsign.com/en/code-signing-certificate)

2. Sign your executable:
```powershell
.\scripts\sign-executable.ps1 -CertificateFile "your-cert.pfx" -Password "your-password"
```

## üîç Why Does This Happen?

BuildIT Agent is flagged because it legitimately:
- ‚úì Monitors running processes (to detect forbidden apps during exams)
- ‚úì Spawns child processes (to execute student code)
- ‚úì Runs a local web server (to receive execution requests)
- ‚úì Enumerates windows (to find unauthorized applications)

These are **legitimate features** for an educational assessment tool, but they look similar to malware behaviors to heuristic scanners.
